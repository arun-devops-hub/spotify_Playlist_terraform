As terraform supports multiple providers, it supports for Spotify too

Now, we will see how TF manages spotify playlist for us.

Step 1:

create one account in developer.spotify.com and create one application.

After that, generate spotify client id and secret id. using these keys tf authenticates with spotify.

clinet_ID = c1e63b2a42374fcc9f0ca74444d4cd94
Secret ID= a52e3e7be50742bfb1f31bfb2ceab149

Pass this keys in tf provider config file, so that tf authes with spotify

Step2:
 
Now that you created the Spotify app, you are ready to configure and start the authorization proxy server, 
which allows Terraform to interact with Spotify. (To publish playlist to spotify we need this key)

To get auth token from spotify, we need to run one docker container 

docker run --rm -it -p 27228:27228 ghcr.io/conradludgate/spotify-auth-proxy

Make sure your container is up and running if you want to publish your playlist.
